// The purpose of the application is to help a fictitious company called Bills Burgers to manage
// their process of selling hamburgers.
// Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to
// be added to the burgers and pricing.
// We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in
// Bills store.
// The basic hamburger should have the following items.
// bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that
// the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items gets charged an additional
// price so you need some way to track how many items got added and to calculate the price (for the base
// burger and all the additions).
// This burger has a base price and the additions are all seperately priced.
// Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
// The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price.
